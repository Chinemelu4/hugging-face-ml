"It seems like you're encountering an issue related to the context length of a language model. The error message indicates that the maximum context length for the model is 4097 tokens, but your request exceeds that limit with 1904115 tokens.

To resolve this issue, you'll need to reduce the length of your input text or split it into smaller segments that fit within the model's maximum context length. This is necessary to ensure that the model can effectively process and generate responses within its capacity.

If you have specific questions or need assistance with a particular aspect of your input, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to help!",,,,2024-02-06 15:42:02.726757
